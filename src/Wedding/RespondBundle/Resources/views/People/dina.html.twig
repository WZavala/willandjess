<p>I have known Jessica since sophomore year, and it has been a blast since then! I have so many memories it’s hard to choose. She was always there for me through thick and thin, and I did my best to do the same. Any time we are together I feel like all we do is laugh! It may be simple, but one of my favorite memories was from one night when we took a late night adventure to the beach. They had just redone the playground and, of course, we turned into little kids on the spot. The night was full of laughter, dancing, ungraceful acrobats, crazy pictures, and solid memories that we both cherish.  I wouldn’t change one thing about that night, nor any time we have spent together. She has been the bestest friend anyone could ask for, as I am sure all who’ve gotten to know her can agree.  
Jess, you are such an amazing person. I don’t know if my life would have been half the adventure it was if I had never known you. For that, I thank you to no end. Love you girl!</p>
