<p>Will and I have been friends for probably 4 years now. I've lost count, which is a good thing because it means that he's become one of my closest friends and that renders time moot. As for how we met, I have KYX to thank for that. We were both Zetas and rushed the same semester. Even though I was significantly older than all but one of the other rushees, I developed strong ties to my fellow Zetas, especially Will. We were both huge fans of videogames, comics, and all things nerdy. Instafriends. I think we bonded most over 2 specific trips, an all-day trip to SuperCon down in Miami, and another week-long escapade that we took together with David, another groomsman, to North Carolina. Good times.</p>
