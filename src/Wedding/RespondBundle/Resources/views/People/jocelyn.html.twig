<p>I remember that fateful day well. It was the first night of Theta Alpha’s fall 2009 Rush week at UCF when I first had the opportunity to hug on that sweet, angelic, dimple-faced cutie; It’s a shame we couldn’t let Will rush though. JUST KIDDING! I am of course referring to the lovely Jessica Collier, and yes, I specifically remember thinking, “this is a dimple-faced cutie”. I digress. A friendship quickly formed between us and we made the decision to become roomies the next year! This is when Jessica and I became more than just friends. She became a sister, a comforter, an encourager, a prayer partner, and most importantly of all, a Real Housewife of New Jersey watcher. My fondest memories took place in that apartment and I will always treasure the tears and the laughter that occurred both inside and outside those walls. Will and Jess are both such dear friends of mine and I am beyond excited to celebrate their marriage. God has an amazing plan for these two and I cannot wait to see how He uses their marriage to bless the people around them. ZAVALA 2013!!</p>
