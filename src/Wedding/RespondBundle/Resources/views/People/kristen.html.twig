<p>Jessica and I met the second week of my freshman year at UCF when I joined Theta Alpha. Soon she was making me dress up as a peculiar looking Oreo and she became my big! I can't these past three years without her friendship and compassion. A while ago, the Theta Alpha retreat was a camping-type trip. Camping is hardly my forte, so Jessica and I were joking about getting "sick" to avoid going. Much to my surprise, I actually became incredibly sick right before the retreat. She brought me ice cream, which became the majority of my meals until I was healthy again. Throughout the time I've known Jess, there have been so many fun times and so many Sweet cupcakes! I've been so blessed to be able to call such a loving and wonderful person my friend!</p>
