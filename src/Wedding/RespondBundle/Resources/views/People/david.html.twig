<p>I remember first meeting will when he pledged Kappa Upsilon Chi. I remember him pledging with Josh & Matt Furlong's pledge class, and then dropping, which made me sad. :( But the next semester, he was back! :) In KYX, like most fraternities, all pledges must meet with, and get the signature of all of the current active members. Naturally, a brother could put any requirement or stipulations on getting said signature. I wanted to have some fun with this, so my requirement was pretty simple: "We have to do something together that you've never done before." I remember that a lot of these were quite fun, for instance Andrew had never had a cup of coffee so we went and got one. Josh had never been to Lazy Moon, so we did that. Will seems to have had the hardest time with this and put my "sig" off until the last. He told me he really couldn't think of anything... so I simply asked "Have I ever made you breakfast?" ..... then he says "That's what we'll do, you will make me breakfast." And so I did. :)</p>

<p>Fast forward a year or so and I remember sitting Matt Furlong down and telling him the whole story of my life so far, my "testimony" if you will. I remember later that Will told me that Matt came back to the apartment and told him that... he had to hear that story. A few weeks later I shared the story with Will.. and since then we've been pretty good friends... something about "I have a lot more respect for you now." haha.</p>
