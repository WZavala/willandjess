<p>Well the story of how Z and I met isn't anything special. I believe it all happened in the 1st grade when one of my childhood friends (aka Chase) introduced me to the new mexican on the block who had just joined our school, and after that all three of us became great friends. Now as for a funny story..... well i guess the best one i can think of off the top of my head is one from a day i was spending at Z's house when he lived with his grandparents. The day started off normal as ever Z and I where having a great time just fishing and playing godzilla on his super nintendo. when we decided to go try and catch this stupid six to eight inch bass that was taunting us by just floating in a foot of clear water right next to the dock we were fishing off of. We had tried basicly everything to get it to bite our hooks that were hanging right infront of its face when if finally decided to go into deeper water and stop taunting us, so after it left Z started fishing out in the deeper part of the creek while i went inside to get something (dont remember what) when all of a sudden i hear Z calling me saying he got a bite. Well i took off to see what he was catching..... unfortunitly for me i forgot THERES A GLASS DOOR BETWEEN ME AND HIM..... needless to say the door won and i ended up on my back thinking "oh yeah they have a sliding glass door." Z got such a kick out of it after he knew i was ok, but it was still funny that i lost to the door.</p>
