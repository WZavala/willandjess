<p>It all started at Maggie Moo's...<br />
I was so fortunate to meet Miss Jessica Katherine Collier upon her joining Theta Alpha Christian Sorority. During our 'signature week' (where all new members were to meet with current members in pursuit of finding a Big/Little relationship) we met at Maggie Moo's for ice cream and immediately connected! The Big/Little relationship is designed to be a discipleship to further grow in our faith with our sisters. I am blessed to have found such a wonderful Big/Little relationship with a foundation in our faith. I am beyond blessed to have established a friendship throughout all of this, and even more blessed to call Jessica my best friend. Immediately upon meeting we hit it off! Jessica has always been someone to encourage me and keep me laughing with her quick sass. I could not be more overjoyed that Jessica has been blessed with such a wonderful man in her life. The relationship they have is joyful and glorifying to the Lord-- they are a wonderful example to follow and great friends to have! I am so grateful to be a member of the wedding party, and even more so to be standing next to my best friend on her big day. I love you Jessica and William!</p>
